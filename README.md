# NoFun

------------------

ðŸ˜Ž `Ioloman/go-no-fun`/NoFun (Not Only FUNctional) provides utility functions inspired by functional-style programming, 
python standard library and "[samber/lo](https://github.com/samber/lo)" Go package. Based on generics. Supports Go 1.18+.

*Designed with simplicity in mind. In this project I will try to implement as simple API as possible sacrificing everything else if needed. 
Signatures like __DoX2 -> DoX9__ is a big no-no*.
